How to allow OneDrive as a disk on your office computer. Download OneDrive and install. Sometimes (after an update) the icon will be in the start menu but the app won't open. This may solve it:

# _The Grid for faster analysis_
How to connect to the grid, choose a node, and use matlab - [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhiliastidesLab/LabBook-wiki-/main/gird_connect1.png).
Read more about the grid [here](https://support.psy.gla.ac.uk/index.php/inst/grid).

ðŸ”¶ Running LDA on the grid allows to run multiple Matlab sessions at the same time. This is useful, when for example you'd like to reduce the time to run multiple participants. 
* Go to the grid (via TightVNC on Windows or RealVNC on a Mac). 
* Open a terminal and type `ssh compute-1-20`. In this example the node number is 1-20. Activity of nodes can bee seen [here](http://ccn00.psy.gla.ac.uk/ganglia/).
* Then in the same terminal type `matlab &`. This will open a Matlab window. 
* To open another Matlab, type `matlab &` in the same terminal (to run on the same node), or open a new terminal and repeat the above steps entering a new node number (e.g. ssh compute-1-21).
